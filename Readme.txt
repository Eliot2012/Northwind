This project is a product system, where it works with a CRUD, and specific events, it adds, saves, edits and deletes any user, product, employee, supplier, order, order detail, shipper, customer and categories.
It has an interesting event which is that every time a user uploads an image, either for a product or for an employee, before it is uploaded, it is first scanned to verify that it does not have a virus or any type of threat, it works through an api that allows us to use its scanner for this purpose.
Another event that I have implemented, is that the users that are not administrators, cannot see the products that are inactive.
